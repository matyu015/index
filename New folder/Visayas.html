            <h2>Carcar Dispensary Museum</h2>
            <p>
                The construction of the Carcar Puericulture & Dispensary was started in 1929 during the American period and completed in 1937. 
                The white painted building was an eye-catcher because the front facade's balcony archway was done with filigree woodwork along with semi-circular transoms, 
                carved barandillas and mini canopies.
