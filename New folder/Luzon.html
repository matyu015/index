            <h2>Pintô Art Museum</h2>
            <p>
                The Pintô Art Museum consists of six buildings and stands on 12,000 square meters 
                (130,000 sq ft) of land at the Grand Heights subdivision in Antipolo, Rizal. 
                The buildings are not air-conditioned and rely on open-air ventilation to preserve its collection.
                Tony Leaño, a Saling Pusa member designed the buildings in an organic and eclectic style.
                The complex has two museums – one for contemporary art and another for indigenous art. 
                It has an academy for literature, visual and performing arts. Pintô also has a cafe, an arboretum.
                The 2000 square meter arboretum has 500 indigeneous plant species as of 2021. The museum hosts the collection of Joven Cuanang.
                Works of Saling Pusa members would be featured in the museum.
                Its largest exhibition space for contemporary art is Gallery 7 which opened in January 2020.

            <h2>Hanging Coffins Of Sagada</h2>
            <p>Hanging coffins are one of the funerary practices among the Kankanaey people of Sagada, 
                Mountain Province, in the island Luzon of the Philippines. They have not been studied by archaeologists, 
                so the exact age of the coffins is unknown, though they are believed to be centuries old. 
                The coffins are placed underneath natural overhangs, either on natural rock shelves/crevices or on projecting beams slotted into holes dug into the cliff-side. 
                The coffins are small because the bodies inside the coffins are in a fetal position. 
                This is due to the belief that people should leave the world in the same position as they entered it, 
                a tradition common throughout the various pre-colonial cultures of the Philippines. 
                The coffins are usually carved by their eventual occupants during their lifetimes.

            <h2>Pagsanjan Falls</h2>
            <p>Pagsanjan Falls, also known as Cavinti Falls (local name: Magdapio Falls), 
                is one of the most famous waterfalls in the Philippines. Located in the province of Laguna, 
                the falls is one of the major tourist attractions of the region. 
                The three-drop waterfall is reached by a river trip on dugout canoe, known locally as "Shooting the Rapids", 
                originating from the municipality of Pagsanjan. The falls can also be reached from the top by a short hike from Cavinti. 
                The boat ride has been an attraction since the Spanish colonial era, with the oldest surviving written account dating to 1894. 
                The town of Pagsanjan lies at the confluence of two rivers, the Balanac River and the Bumbungan River (also known as the Pagsanjan River).
