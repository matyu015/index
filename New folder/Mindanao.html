            <p>
                The Hinatuan Enchanted River, also called the Hinatuan Sacred River, 
                is a deep spring river on the island of Mindanao in the Philippines. 
                It flows into the Philippine Sea and the Pacific Ocean at Barangay Talisay, Hinatuan, Surigao del Sur. 
                It is found between the boundaries of Barangays of Talisay and Cambatong. 
                It earned the moniker "enchanted river" from the diplomat Modesto Farolan who described the river in his poem entitled "Rio Encantado".
